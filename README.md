python script for saving tab contents, config and ssfn* files to your email from steam

ssfn* is the steam guard file (Steam Guard, the Steam client generates a file named "ssfn" followed by a series of numbers. This file is stored on the device you're using and is associated with your Steam account. It is used as part of the two-factor authentication process to verify your identity when logging in. The ssfn file is stored locally on your device and is specific to that device.) (example: ssfn1000080598613390841 - this is your steam guard ID) 

using the ssfn string hackers can bypass your 2fa on steam and access all of your data
